        <div class="collapsed features__item_text features__item_text--09">As a student, you are likely locked into a one-year rent contract. This means that during some periods of the year (like school breaks), you are paying rent on an apartment you aren't living in. We market and manage your apartment on multiple short-term rental platforms (like Airbnb) to earn rent revenue. This rent revenue is split between:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Arca (~30%)</li>
            <li>Your landlord (~10%)</li>
            <li>And you, the tenant (~60%)</li> 
          </ul>
        Our commission helps cover the cost of creating a proper online listing which involves photography, cleaning, amenities, and more. We also give some money to the landlord in order to incentivize them to authorize sub-leasing. And you, of course, are paid the majority of the revenue as it is your apartment. These percentages, however, will change depending on multiple variables and so are subject to negotiation.</div>

        <div class="collapsed features__item_text features__item_text--09">Our service is specifically designed for students who won't be in Milan to live in their apartment during certain parts of the year. If you aren't in the city your apartment is in, you will have to pay someone to manage your apartment regardless. There is a learning curve for sub-lease management that we have gone through already and using us would allow you to complete your internship, semester abroad, or vacation in peace. <br><br>However, if you feel that managing your own apartment is best in your situation, feel free to do so!</div>

        <div class="collapsed features__item_text features__item_text--09">Italian law responds very clearly to this question. The reference article is n.2, Law n. 392/78. The law explains that total sublease is not possible (unless with owner's consent), while a partial sublease is allowed (unless the owner refuses). Any form of sublease is legal if a specific clause inserted in the contract.<br><br>Warning!<br>For temporary and transitory student contracts, subletting is prohibited. The clause must be included in the rental contract, as required by the Italian Convention.</div>

        <div class="collapsed features__item_text features__item_text--09">Here are all the steps you need to take to start a sub-lease:<br><br>1) Communication to the owner: a registered letter must be sent to the owner containing the information of the third party (sub-conductor), the duration of the sub-lease, and the number of rooms given in sub-lease.<br><br>2) If the sub-lease exceeds 30 days, register the sublease contract, paying 2% registration tax. The registration must be made within 30 days from the signing of the contract, at the offices of the Revenue Agency, and following the payment of the registration tax using the F24 Elide model.<br><br>3) If sub-conductor is non-EU citizen, present a "declaration of hospitality" model to denounce the subletting.</div>
